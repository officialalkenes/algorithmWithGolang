### Golang Exercises: Structs, Datatypes, Conditions, and Loops

#### **Struct Exercises**
1. Define a struct `Person` with fields `Name` (string), `Age` (int), and `PhoneNumber` (string). Write a function to print a formatted description of a `Person`.
2. Create a struct `Rectangle` with fields `Length` and `Width` (both float64). Write a method to calculate and return the area of the rectangle.
3. Define a struct `Book` with fields `Title`, `Author`, and `Price`. Create a slice of `Book` structs and write a function to display all books priced below a given value.
4. Create a struct `Student` with fields `Name`, `Grades` (slice of ints), and `AverageGrade`. Write a function to calculate and update the average grade for a `Student`.
5. Implement a struct `Car` with fields `Make`, `Model`, and `Year`. Write a function to check if a car is a classic (more than 25 years old).
6. Define a struct `Employee` with fields `Name`, `Position`, and `Salary`. Write a function to give an employee a raise by a percentage of their current salary.
7. Create a struct `Point` with fields `X` and `Y` (both int). Write a function to calculate the distance between two points.
8. Implement a struct `Movie` with fields `Title`, `Genre`, and `Rating` (float64). Write a function to filter and return a slice of movies with a rating above 8.0.
9. Define a struct `Circle` with fields `Radius` and a method `Perimeter` that calculates its perimeter.
10. Create a nested struct `Address` inside a `User` struct, where `Address` contains fields `Street`, `City`, and `ZipCode`. Write a function to update a user's address.

#### **Datatypes Exercises**
11. Write a program to check if a given number (int) is even or odd.
12. Create a function that takes a slice of strings and returns a new slice containing only strings with more than 3 characters.
13. Write a program to convert a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
14. Create a map with keys as country names (string) and values as their population (int). Write a function to find and display the population of a given country.
15. Write a function that accepts a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
16. Create a program that converts a given integer into its binary representation.
17. Write a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the smallest and largest numbers in the slice.
18. Implement a program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.
19. Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
20. Create a function that takes a slice of floats and returns the average of all the values.

#### **Condition and Loop Exercises**
21. Write a program to print the first 20 Fibonacci numbers using a loop.
22. Create a function to determine if a number is prime. Use a loop to test numbers up to 100 and display all prime numbers.
23. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using both a loop and recursion.
24. Create a program that reads an integer input and prints a multiplication table for that number (up to 10).
25. Write a loop to iterate over a slice of strings and print only those strings that start with the letter `A`.
26. Write a program to find the largest number in a slice using a loop.
27. Create a nested loop to print the following pattern:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```
28. Write a program to reverse the digits of an integer using a loop.
29. Use a `for` loop with a `break` statement to stop the loop when a certain condition is met (e.g., reaching a value in a sequence).
30. Write a program to count the number of occurrences of each character in a given string using a loop and a map.
